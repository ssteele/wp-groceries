## WP Groceries

*A WordPress plugin that parses recipes and items and renders a grocery list ordered by aisle for multiple stores/users*

### Description

WP Groceries works in tandem with my recipes WordPress plugin and theme to aide in shopping. The user can choose from saved recipes and other random ingredients to create a grocery list. The items are sorted by aisle for the chosen store. An easy drag and drop mobile interface allows for re-sorting while shopping. These updates are persisted for future shopping trips. In theory, and barring a store's natural tendency to re-order, each shopping trip will increase the granularity of item sorting. The plugin can be employed by many users. Each user can store the ordering of food items for any number of stores.
